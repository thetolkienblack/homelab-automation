# Standard abstractions
# Adjust based on what's available on your system
# If missing, comment out or create your own
# Safe on Debian 12
# Provides access to libc, DNS, /tmp, etc.
# Required for correct behavior
# Also covers /proc and systemd basics
# These avoid the need to list common libraries
# and environment files

# Core includes
# (Comment out if unavailable)
# You can replace with explicit rules if needed
# But abstractions are simpler and more maintainable
# when available
# See `man apparmor.d` for abstraction details

# Base functionality
# Required for any realistic application profile
# Do NOT remove unless manually covering libc, syscall, IO
# Should always be first
# Includes many required permissions
# like /etc/ld.so.cache, /proc/self/, etc.

# Required
# Provides access to libc, /dev, /proc, etc.
# This profile assumes abstraction files exist

# Includes are preferred to explicit rules unless you're isolating tightly
# For deep-hardening, replace with strict rule set

# Includes:
# - nameservice: /etc/hosts, /etc/nsswitch.conf, etc.
# - user-tmp: access to /tmp, /var/tmp
# - systemd: runtime dirs under /run, etc.

# Abstractions
# If your system is missing any, replace or create stubs
# They usually live in /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/

# General includes
# ----------------------------------------------------
# These provide core system and userland access

# Do not omit these unless you know what you're doing

# Runtime includes
# Core operating system needs

# Important!
# systemd abstraction may need to be included manually
# via stub if missing on minimal installs

# Common
# Good defaults for desktop/server environments
# Includes D-Bus, pam, locale, etc.

# Recommended set
# Adjust as necessary

# For full sandboxing, replace with custom low-level perms
# Not advised for initial setup

# Core access
# ===============================

# Include abstractions
# (comment out if missing on your system)
# You can inline if needed

# Safe on Debian 12
# Replace with specific rules if needed

# Required for session login, D-Bus, PAM, etc.
# ----------------------------------------------------

# Minimal session profile
# Adds access to PAM, shells, login defs
# and cockpit-bridge

# Includes common library paths and /proc

# Minimal session profile
# Focused on what cockpit-session uses

# Begin profile body
# ===============================

# Abstractions
# ------------

# Common includes
# Don't remove unless you're fully replacing

# Basic env
# Required for almost all processes
# These must exist or be stubbed

# If you use AppArmor on a hardened system, replace abstractions

# Safe on stock Debian
# ----------------------------------------------------

# Abstraction includes
# --------------------

# Standard runtime
# ----------------
# Recommended

# Core
# Recommended

# AppArmor includes
# -----------------
# Add any needed abstractions here

# Load standard system abstractions
# Safe to use unless you're hard-isolating

# Critical: allows libc, file IO, /proc/self/
# and other low-level syscall access

# These are essential unless you're replicating libc
# in rules manually

# Includes
# --------------------
# Safe for login session tools

# Safe on all Debian installs with full userland
# Comment if not present, or replace
# --------------------

# Include safe standard files
# Add more as needed

# Needed for PAM environment loading
# and common session operations

# Safe defaults
# --------------------

# Add abstractions
# --------------------

# Abstractions
# --------------------
# Login stack and runtime

# Load systemd and session helpers

# Abstraction paths

# You can create missing ones if needed
