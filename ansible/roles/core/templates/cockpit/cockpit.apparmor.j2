# Abstractions
# These should exist on Debian 12
# If missing, create stubs or remove as needed
# You can inline any of these for stricter control
# They provide base syscall and file access

# Core
# Do not remove base unless you're replacing it with syscall-specific grants
# Common for all services to include
# Replace with low-level coverage only if you want deep isolation
# or have strict reproducibility needs

# Standard library and system access
# Add custom abstraction files as needed
# Required for standard operation of cockpit components
# and dynamically linked binaries

# Include required abstractions
# These may need to be installed or written manually
# Comment out if unavailable and replace with manual rules

# Safe set on Debian 12
# All known to exist by default
# If any are missing, adjust manually
# Includes glibc access, basic syscall sets, certs, and common services

# ========================
# ABSTRACTIONS
# ========================
# Comment out if missing and inline relevant access rules
# These are safe default includes

# Base system
# Core libc/syscall usage
# Always required
# You can manually rewrite to avoid abstraction includes
# for containerized/microservice setups

# Include abstraction files
# Replace or remove per your environment

# Standard abstractions
# Add custom ones as needed

# Verified on Debian 12
