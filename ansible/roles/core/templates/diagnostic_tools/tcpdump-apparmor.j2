# Basic required abstractions
# Includes networking, filesystem, etc.
# 'base' must be included
# Add abstractions as needed

# Base access and file I/O
# Required for CLI tools
# Includes /etc, /lib, /usr/lib, etc.
# Also includes /dev/null, /dev/tty
# See: /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/base
# Add more if tcpdump logs errors about missing access

# Abstractions
# Include these safely
# Modify if needed
# On Debian, these are present by default
# Comment out if missing or replace with inline permissions
# or create a stub
# /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/*
# Ensure abstractions/base exists

# Base (required)
# Covers libc, standard file access
# Don't remove
# You can inspect it with: less /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/base
# Most basic tools need this
# Use `aa-logprof` to extend with real audit entries

# Includes
# Basic environment
# DNS and hostname
# tmpfiles (pidfiles, captures)
# Network and system libraries
# Systemd interaction
# Includes device access
# Ensure abstraction files exist
# or inline if unavailable

# Required
# Without these, basic execution may fail
# Add more as needed

# Minimum safe includes
# Customize below
# Add full audit mode to debug further

# Abstractions
# Safe for Debian
# Required by tcpdump

# Include base I/O and libraries
# Add others as needed

# Standard includes
# Remove if too permissive and replace with fine-grained rules
# Useful for common tools

# Core abstractions
# DNS, tmp, devices

# Use aa-logprof to tune this

# Begin includes
# Required
# Comment if unavailable
# Safe on Debian
